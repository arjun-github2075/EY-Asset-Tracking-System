                        Google Cloud Run is a fully managed serverless execution environment for containers. It allows
                        you to run
                        stateless HTTP-driven containers on a fully managed environment or in your own Google Kubernetes
                        Engine
                        cluster. Cloud Run automatically scales your containers based on incoming request traffic, so
                        you only pay
                        for the resources you use. It supports containers built with popular languages and frameworks,
                        such as
                        Docker and Knative.

                        With Cloud Run, you can build and deploy microservices and APIs quickly and easily. It abstracts
                        away the
                        underlying infrastructure, allowing you to focus on writing code and delivering value. Cloud Run
                        offers
                        seamless integration with other Google Cloud services, such as Cloud Build for CI/CD pipelines
                        and Cloud
                        Monitoring for observability.

                        Google Cloud Filestore is a managed file storage service for applications that require a
                        traditional
                        file system interface. It provides a fully managed Network Attached Storage (NAS) solution with
                        high
                        performance and scalability. With Cloud Filestore, you can easily share files between instances
                        or
                        clusters of virtual machines and achieve consistent file access from multiple compute instances.
                        The
                        benefits of using Cloud Filestore include high performance, data durability, and seamless
                        integration
                        with other Google Cloud services. However, it is primarily designed for Linux-based workloads
                        and may
                        not be suitable for all use cases.

                        Cloud Filestore offers two performance tiers: Standard and Premium. The Standard tier provides a
                        cost-effective solution for workloads with moderate performance requirements, while the Premium
                        tier
                        offers higher performance and lower latency for latency-sensitive applications. It integrates
                        with
                        other Google Cloud services, such as Compute Engine and Kubernetes Engine, enabling you to build
                        scalable and reliable applications.
